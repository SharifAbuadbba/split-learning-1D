**Available Now:**
- Our 1D CNN split learning models with their accuracy results.
- Our pre-processed training/testing samples of MIT arrhythmia ECG database.
- Our privacy leakage 3 measurements results using visual invertibility; distance correlation; and Dynamic Time Warping.
- Our proposed two countermeasures results: i) increasing the number of layers in a CNN model and ii) using differential privacy.
